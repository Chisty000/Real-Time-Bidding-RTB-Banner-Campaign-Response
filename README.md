# Real Time Bidding
The project encompasses of RTB implementation. It uses dummy data from the test given. 

## Parsing of Data
- Parses both the Bid Request and Campaign Data
- Implements checking if the parsing is being done correctly

## Generating RTB Responses

The code generates RTB Responses based on google sample response data.
But the response is not entirely hardcoded it takes key values from the campaign data.
Further room of improvements exist in the script. 

## Room for Improvements
- The code does produces the response however it is not completely dynamic. It does uses some hardcoded data.
- Test case implementation is required one the data operates completely dynamically.
